#' makeBoxPlot -- creates boxplot of contigs included in the analysis vs those excluded
#' @param chrTable  A GRanges object consisting of contigs and positions. A meta column called 'names' must be present with names in the same

#' @param linkage.contigs A list of clustered contigs, generated by clusterContigs()
#' @aliases makeBoxPlot makeBoxPlot-ChrTable-LinkageGroupList-method
#' @rdname makeBoxPlot
#' @example inst/examples/makeBoxPlot.R
