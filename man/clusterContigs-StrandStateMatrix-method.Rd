\title{clusterContigs -- agglomeratively clusters contigs into linkage groups based on strand inheritance}
\usage{
\S4method{clusterContigs}{StrandStateMatrix}(object, similarityCutoff = 0.7,
  recluster = NULL, minimumLibraryOverlap = 5, randomise = TRUE,
  randomSeed = NULL, randomWeight = NULL, snowCluster = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{data.frame} containing strand inheritance information for every contig (rows)
in every library (columns). This should be the WW/CC only matrix.}

\item{similarityCutoff}{place contigs in a cluster when their strand state is at least this similar}

\item{recluster}{=NULL Number of times to recluster and take the consensus of. If NULL, clustering is 
run only once.}

\item{minimumLibraryOverlap}{for two contigs to be clustered together, the strand inheritance must 
be present for both contigs in at least this many libraries (in addition to their similarity being at least 
similarityCutoff)}

\item{randomise}{whether to reorder contigs before clustering}

\item{randomSeed}{random seed to initialize clustering}

\item{randomWeight}{vector of weights for contigs for resampling. If NULL, uniform resampling is used.
Typically this should be a measure of contig quality, such as library coverage, so that clustering tends to
start from the better quality contigs.}

\item{snowCluster}{optional snowCluster for parallel execution}

\item{verbose}{= TRUE prints function progress}
}
\value{
\code{LinkageGroupList} of vectors containing labels of contigs belonging to each linkage
group
}
\description{
clusterContigs -- agglomeratively clusters contigs into linkage groups based on strand inheritance
}
\details{
Note that a more stringent similarity cutoff will result in more clusters, and a longer run time,
since at every iteration a distance is computed to the existing clusters. However, in lower-quality data, a
more stringent cutoff may be necessary to reduce the number of contigs that are erroneously grouped.
